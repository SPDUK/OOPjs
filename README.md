Just some basic notes for OOP stuff, testing out typescript a little bit plus it compiles to es5 code so you can see how things are handled in es5 JS

Read .ts files for ES6, .js files for ES5

TL;DR:
\_\_proto\_\_ goes onto an object returned from a class

prototype is on the class 




folders:
- class: the keyword 'class' and what it does
- new: the keyword 'new' when used to create a class

- this: keyword 'this'
